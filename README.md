moodle-enrol_oss
====================

enrolment plugin for moodle from 3.x to autoenrol in
conjunction with the open school server enrol_oss.

It is supposed to work with the

Open School Server (www.openschoolserver.net)

servers.

It is crafted for their LDAP structure.

It needs the auth_ldap module working to get the users authenticated
through LDAP and enrols those users to courses depending on the
field $course->idnumber.

Dependencies
------------
This module needs the Auth-Plugin auth_ldap and the enrolment plugin
enrol_cohort to be active to work properly.

Cron-Job
--------
This module is processed by cron on an hourly basis, as is enrol_cohort
equally.

The module auth_ldap is not automatically processed by cron.
There is a scheduled task available but it is deactivated by default.

Activate it and schedule it for hourly execution.

Parents
-------
To use this new feature you need to create the parent role as outlined
in https://docs.moodle.org/34/en/Parent_role. The role shortname needs to
match configuration on the settings page.

The parents can be imported from file, which needs to be of certain structure.

username;lastname;firstname;email

E-Mail can be fake mail with example.com but needs to be unique, f.e.
"nobody####@example.com" with student no. ####.
There is a patch discussed on https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=96114
which makes non unique email addresses possible.
This patch is very helpful, because parents of siblings get multiple parent accounts.
In newer moodle versions there is the setting "allowaccountssmaeemail", which
reduces the mentioned patch to the file emailupdate.php.

username must be "eltern_####", where #### is the student no. in ldap structure.

The number is used to create the relationship between parent and student automatically.
